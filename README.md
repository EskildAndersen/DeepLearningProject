# DeepLearningProject
Repo for our Deep Learning Project 2022
Image Caption Deep Neural Network Model (ICPNNM)

In the following repo we have tried designing our own Image Caption Generator by constructing a Deep Learning Auto-encoder model. 
Images and captions are gathered from the Flickr8k image dataset from Kaggle "https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adityajn105/flickr8k"
All code are written in Python using Pytorch. 

# Pathing

All Py-scripts are stored in the main folder. The 'data' folder consists of the 'images' folder with images and 'texts' with labels and corresponding image-path.
Finally the 'features' also exist which holds the feature vector that has been fed through the CNN.
